# Flipping Credit Card Effect Using SwiftUI

This project was written using SwiftUI in order to create an animation of a credit card being flipped to see the back where you can see additional information. This view can be used for any applications that want to animate user interactions during a transaction.


### To-Do
- Create a the area on the back to hold the security code and include a mad stripe to make it look for authentic
- Let the users interact with the card, such as letting them change the card number, expiration date, and name dynamically.
